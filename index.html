          Hi! My name is Qien Ybarra. I'm an intermediate web developer and am
          currently learning the ropes of important web dev essentials such as
          CSS Grid, Flexbox, JavaScript, etc... My interests are anything tech;
          I like Gaming, Programming, and working with 3D Art in Blender.
          Usually, I'll spend time working more on my programming skills to
          sharpen my range of web development capabilities, and I spend my extra
          time either playing games or working on Blender projects. I'm a social
          person and not too shy to talk to people, and I like to know others'
          interests too. I try my best to be a likable person and be fair to
          people whom I trust and who trust me. As a programmer in the learning
          process, I intend on starting freelance work sooner or later, as it
          will be a great way to practice my skills to put them to work and to
          help others in general that need a task done.
